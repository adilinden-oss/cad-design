# Round Mesh Cover For 2.5in Hole

Shared on Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5612740

## Summary

I am trying to keep worms for composting. The bin needs air holes. To keep the worms from escaping, those air holes best be covered with some mesh. This is a 3D printed bolt on mesh cover for 2-1/2 inch holes. Why 2-1/2 one might wonder? That's the largest hole saw in my inventory today.

Good bed adhesion is a must else the mesh will be a mess.
