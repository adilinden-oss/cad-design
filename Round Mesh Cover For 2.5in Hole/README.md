# Round Mesh Cover For 2.5in Hole

Shared on Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5612740

## Summary

I am trying to keep worms for composting. The bin needs air holes. To keep the worms from escaping, those air holes best be covered with some mesh. This is a 3D printed bolt on mesh cover for 2-1/2 inch holes. Why 2-1/2 one might wonder? That's the largest hole saw in my inventory today. There are two parts to this design. The outside part has the mesh integrated, the inside part is just a support for the bolt through nuts.

I choose to make airholes in the lid of the bin. The first step is to drill the 2-1/2 inch hole. I used a holesaw running at slow speed to not tear up the plastic. Then one of the rings is centered over the hole and used as a template for the bolt holes. The bolt holes are drilled with an appropriate sized drill bit for #6 machine screws. I strongly recommend stainless steel or nylon screws. Last is the assembly, with the mesh part placed on the outside and support ring on the inside. The support ring has convenient indentations to hold the nuts in place. Holes for the screws were designed with actual dimensions of the bolt head and nut from packages stainless bolts from my local Home Hardware.
