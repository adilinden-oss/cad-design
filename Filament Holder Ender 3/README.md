# Filament Holder Ender 3

Shared on Thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3375204

## Summary

I've been seeing occasional under-extrusion from my Ender 3. I noticed that the filament spool did not at all unwind smoothly. After changing the spool to rest on ball bearings on the table top those issues went away. However, I prefer the filament on top of the printer. So here is my take on a filament holder for the Ender 3.

Some additional non-3D printed parts are needed, in particular 4 608zz bearings and 2 axles. I used 8mm aluminum tubing, but 5/16 dowel should work too.

I also have the [source files](https://github.com/adilinden-oss/cad-design/tree/master/Filament%20Holder%20Ender%203) for design on GitHub.

I printed the frame, rollers and washers independently. The following notes on settings:

- Print frame with supports
- Print washers with brim
- Print roller halves without support

The following quantities are needed:

- Frame (Frame.stl): 1
- Roller A (Roller A.stl): 2
- Roller B (Roller B.stl): 2
- Washer (Washer.stl): 4

Additional parts (not 3D printed):

- Bearings 608zz: 4
- Axles 8mm diameter: 2
